// FizzBuzz Whiteboard Challenge

// Use VSCode to complete this challenge.

// Do not use intellisense. The point of this exercise is to complete the challenge with no help from the computer  (like what it would be like during a whiteboard interview):



// Write a public method that accepts a number
// when the number is divisible by 3 return the word fizz

// when the number is divisible by 5 return the word buzz

// when the number is divisible by both, return the word fizzbuzz
